<h1> The implementation of Supoort Vector Machie with CVXOPT in Python </h1>
<p1>This is the most sysmple type of SVM where all examples 
    are linearly separable. In this case, the form of the 
    primal and dual problem become very symple. So before 
    learning about non-separable case, I write here what 
    I've recently learnt.
